# AquaVision – Underwater Image Processing and Enhancement

## Overview

AquaVision is an AI and computer vision-based system designed to enhance underwater images, demonstrating how machine learning can improve visual clarity, color correction, and feature extraction in challenging underwater environments.

This repository contains a **sanitized academic version** of an academic project. No proprietary or confidential data is included.

## Key Features

* Enhancement of underwater images for better clarity and visibility
* Color correction and dehazing of underwater scenes
* Noise reduction and detail preservation
* Modular and extensible project structure for academic experimentation

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning & Deep Learning
* Computer Vision (OpenCV, scikit-image)
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Project Structure

* `src/` – source code for image enhancement and processing algorithms
* `data/` – sample underwater images for demonstration
* `docs/` – project documentation, diagrams, and results

## Confidentiality Notice

All data, logic, and implementations are generalized and intended strictly for **educational and demonstration purposes**. No proprietary or real-world industrial images are included.
